# This file is used to build the navBar menu

# It is essentially a map of the folder structure

# The entries in this file tell Jekyll which pages to link
# in the navbar and where those pages exist

# Caution!
# Pages not linked below are still accessible in the final
# site unless you specifically exclude them in _config.yml
# They will however, not be present in the navBar

# You can specify custom URLs for files using url: "filename"
# However, if you follow a good naming convention, the
# automagic url linking below will work out!

# If url is skipped, the text will be slugified.
# It's lowercased, " " and "/" are replaced with " "
# See also: https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/filters/#slugify

# If you are linking to a folder, the folder/index.md
# file will be opened by default

# To maintain the base (parent) URL, just use url: ""
