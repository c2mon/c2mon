   * the current value in the cache for instance), never accepting older updates. This must be done as 
   * there is no guarantee that a "revalidation" supervision event will not be overtaken by a newer valid
   * update, which will have a more recent server timestamp (since the revalidation notification is
   * using the timestamp of the previous value).
