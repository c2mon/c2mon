        <desc>This JAR is part of C2MON's persistence layer. It manages
            all the incoming requests to commit data to C2MON's DB by providing a fallback mechanism that guarantees that not
            data will be lost in case there is a DB failure. The backup mechanism is normally implemented by
            creating in the server some additional text files. In case of DB issues the data will be logged into these
            files instead and it will be automatically recovered once the DB is back. The code is generic enough
            to allow its use by any other C2MON project that has to deal with the persistence layer.
